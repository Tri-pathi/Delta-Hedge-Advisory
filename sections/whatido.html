                <a class="accordion-title">Non-Executive Director/Board Adviser<span></span></a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>I remain a non-executive director at Frank, after stepping down from my day-to-day role as managing partner of the agency I founded. <br />
                    <br /> I’m also board advisor to a number of high-growth start-ups, working with business leaders to help them achieve their goals and overcome their challenges. I work with organisations of all sizes which are experiencing
                    rapid growth, whether they need to respond to a particular market challenge, want to crack a marketing campaign or are looking to create new business opportunities. <br />
                    <br /> What all these companies have in common is real ambition, and what they need is someone who’ll understand their business objectives and be there at the end of the phone for immediate practical advice – not a remote figurehead
                    wheeled out for AGMs.</div>

                <a class="accordion-title">Agency Performance and Growth<span></span></a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>I help marketing services agencies improve their performance and maximise their growth by helping them unlock their true potential. I work with agency founders and senior management teams to identify the issues which are preventing
                    maximum agency performance and am totally hands on in developing practical steps for improvement. After over two decades in the business, I know all the potential pitfalls – and how to avoid them.<br />
                    <br /> My services include: growth strategies and business planning, service innovation and expansion strategies, financial performance and profit improvement, agency marketing and proactive new business development, client
                    retention and growth plans, senior management mentoring, talent recruitment, retention and development. You might not be certain where I can best support you, just that you need guidance. Let’s chat.</div>

                <a class="accordion-title">Mergers and Acquisitions<span></span></a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>I advise buy-side clients who are looking to make strategic acquisitions in the marketing services area. I source off-market, under the radar assets – the best businesses in the world, those that don’t necessarily have a ‘For Sale’
                    sign above their door. On the sell-side of the business, I advise marketing services agencies who are looking for an exit, and help them get the best possible deal. </div>

                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>I work with businesses on a project or interim basis to help crack their marketing challenge and create great work by helping them find the best agencies and people to meet their requirements, whatever the discipline. I work with
                    companies to set up their agency relationships to ensure they get the most out of them, and when required, I stay involved to see the job through. My little black book will be at your disposal, as will I.</div>

                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>Finding the right celebrity for your brand can be tough. I find and secure the best talent for your business to partner with – from world renowned personalities to the biggest social media influencers. I'll negotiate the fee, draw
                    up the contract, help agree the creative brief, and if required, oversee the campaign to ensure it delivers.</div>
