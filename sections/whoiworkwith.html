                    <h3>Frank</h3>
                    <p>As co-founder of <a href="https://welcometofrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Frank</strong></a>, I shaped one of the UK’s most respected PR agencies. Frank has represented some of the nation’s best-known brands
                        – from Coca-Cola to Weetabix – and is one of the industry’s most decorated agencies.</p>
                    <p>If you’ve ever squeaked ‘Simples’ when seeing a meerkat then you’ve experienced the power of a Frank campaign. In 2007, I helped facilitate the sale of Frank to Australian marketing services firm Enero (ASX:EGG). A subsequent
                        deal saw a proportion of equity return to the management team. In 2020, I stepped down from my day-to-day role as managing partner of Frank to become a non-executive director. In early 2021, the Frank management team completed
                        an MBO, returning Frank to a fully-owned independent business.</p>
