            My portfolio includes non-executive director, board advisory,
            consultancy and project roles for a range of businesses and
            agencies, mainly within communications and marketing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I bring an ultra-effective, practical and straight-forward approach

            of the very best people in the industry. So you can be confident
            that I will know just the right fit for your business – whether
            that’s an agency, freelancer, brand, celebrity or influencer.

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                I remain a non-executive director at Frank, after stepping down
                from my day-to-day role as managing partner of the agency I
                founded. <br />
                <br />
                I’m also board advisor to a number of high-growth start-ups,
                working with business leaders to help them achieve their goals
                and overcome their challenges. I work with organisations of all
                sizes which are experiencing rapid growth, whether they need to
                respond to a particular market challenge, want to crack a
                marketing campaign or are looking to create new business
                opportunities. <br />
                <br />
                What all these companies have in common is real ambition, and
                what they need is someone who’ll understand their business
                objectives and be there at the end of the phone for immediate
                practical advice – not a remote figurehead wheeled out for AGMs.

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                I help marketing services agencies improve their performance and
                maximise their growth by helping them unlock their true
                potential. I work with agency founders and senior management
                teams to identify the issues which are preventing maximum agency
                performance and am totally hands on in developing practical
                steps for improvement. After over two decades in the business, I
                know all the potential pitfalls – and how to avoid them.<br />
                <br />
                My services include: growth strategies and business planning,
                service innovation and expansion strategies, financial
                performance and profit improvement, agency marketing and
                proactive new business development, client retention and growth
                plans, senior management mentoring, talent recruitment,
                retention and development. You might not be certain where I can
                best support you, just that you need guidance. Let’s chat.

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                I advise buy-side clients who are looking to make strategic
                acquisitions in the marketing services area. I source
                off-market, under the radar assets – the best businesses in the
                world, those that don’t necessarily have a ‘For Sale’ sign above
                their door. On the sell-side of the business, I advise marketing
                services agencies who are looking for an exit, and help them get
                the best possible deal.

              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                I work with businesses on a project or interim basis to help
                crack their marketing challenge and create great work by helping
                them find the best agencies and people to meet their
                requirements, whatever the discipline. I work with companies to
                set up their agency relationships to ensure they get the most
                out of them, and when required, I stay involved to see the job
                through. My little black book will be at your disposal, as will
                I.

                Finding the right celebrity for your brand can be tough. I find
                and secure the best talent for your business to partner with –
                from world renowned personalities to the biggest social media
                influencers. I'll negotiate the fee, draw up the contract, help
                agree the creative brief, and if required, oversee the campaign
                to ensure it delivers.

                    ><strong>Frank</strong></a
                  >, I shaped one of the UK’s most respected PR agencies. Frank
                  has represented some of the nation’s best-known brands – from
                  Coca-Cola to Weetabix – and is one of the industry’s most
                  decorated agencies.

                  If you’ve ever squeaked ‘Simples’ when seeing a meerkat then
                  you’ve experienced the power of a Frank campaign. In 2007, I
                  helped facilitate the sale of Frank to Australian marketing
                  services firm Enero (ASX:EGG). A subsequent deal saw a
                  proportion of equity return to the management team. In 2020, I
                  stepped down from my day-to-day role as managing partner of
                  Frank to become a non-executive director. In early 2021, the
                  Frank management team completed an MBO, returning Frank to a
                  fully-owned independent business.
